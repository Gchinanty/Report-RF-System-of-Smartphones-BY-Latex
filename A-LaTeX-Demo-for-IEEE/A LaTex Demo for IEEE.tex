\section{Introduction}
During the learning process of RF circuits, the most important thing is to combine theory with practice. As we all know, our smartphones contain a complete RF system. It is beneficial for us to have a brief understanding about it. So I searched for information about my iPhone 7 on the Internet and made a report. 

The remainder of this report is organized as follows. We have a general look at RF overall architecture in Section \ref{sec:rfa}. In Section \ref{sec:wsfb} we introduce cellular and wireless about iPhone 7 in detail. Section \ref{sec:rfc} and \ref{sec:orfc} describe RF components on iPhone 7.In Section \ref{sec:dw}, we will see different waveforms in different working modes. Section \ref{sec:orft} shows other RF transceivers chips about smartphones. Finally, the conclusions are laid out in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{RF Architecture}\label{sec:rfa}
RF architecture of iPhone 7 adopt Qualcomm RFFE solution. The overall block diagram is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:RF_Architecture}.

\begin{figure*}[hb]
	\centering
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.92\linewidth]{RF_Architecture}
		\caption{\text{RF Overall Architecture\cite{Qualcomm.org}}} \label{fig:RF_Architecture}	
	\end{center}	
\end{figure*}

From Fig.\ref{fig:RF_Architecture}, we can see that RF overall architecture is consist of several units. We make a brief introduction of them and their functions as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{Modem}}}: Modems are used to transmit digital information via analog systems. The word "modem" is derived from the term "modulator-demodulator." The essential functions of a modem are to modulate an analog carrier signal to carry digital information; and to demodulate a similar signal so as to decode the digital information from the analog carrier signal\cite{7334868}.
	
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{RF Transceiver}}}: RF transceiver module is used in a particular device where both the transmitter and receiver houses in a single module. Such devices transmit and receives RF signal, so that is named as RF Transceiver. Mostly the position of RF Transceiver module is in between Power amplifier/Low Noise Amplifier and Baseband MODEM in any wireless communication system. Baseband Modem houses, chip sets of several analog or digital modulation techniques and analog to digital conversion or digital to analog conversion chips\cite{6756237},\cite{Exefx.org}.
	
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{Power Amplifier Modules}}}: PA modules bring together multiplexers, filters, RF switches and LNAs to allow highly integrated transmit and receive chains and optimized envelope tracking for premium RF performance while helping to reduce the manufacturerâ€™s time-to-launch\cite{Qualcomm.org}.
	
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{RF Switch and Switch Module}}}: An RF Switch is a device to route high frequency signals through transmission paths. RF and microwave switches are used extensively in microwave test systems for signal routing between instruments and devices under test (DUT)\cite{RFwikipedia.org}. Incorporating a switch into a switch matrix system enables you to route signals from multiple instruments to single or multiple DUTs. This allows multiple tests to be performed with the same setup, eliminating the need for frequent connects and disconnects. The entire testing process can be automated, increasing the throughput in high-volume production environments\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Truman16}.
	
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{Low Noise Amplifier}}}: Extensive portfolio of integrated and discrete low noise amplifiers (LNAs) to support high performance receive and diversity receive chains in advanced multi-mode, multi-band designs\cite{Qualcomm.org}.
		
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{Filter Products}}}: Electronic filters are circuits which perform signal processing functions, specifically to remove unwanted frequency components from the signal, to enhance wanted ones, or both. Electronic filters can be: passive or active. analog or digital\cite{Electronic_filter.org}. Extensive portfolio of high performance embedded and discrete duplexers, diplexers, extractors, and acoustic filters including SAW, TC-SAW and BAW filters\cite{Qualcomm.org}.
		
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{Antenna Tuner}}}: Antenna Tuner allows the mismatch between the antenna and PA to be minimized. The tuner can operate in open and closed-loop modes. In both the open and closed-loop modes, static (time invariant) mismatch can be addressed, allowing the frequency dependence of the antenna and the RF front-end to be effectively compensated\cite{6546299}.
	
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{Power Trackers}}}: A power tracker is a device that adjusts payload according to the change of power.
	
	\item {\bfseries{\emph{Diversity Receive Module}}}: Diversity receive modules (DRx modules) combine switches, filters and low-noise amplifiers into a module, providing a highly integrated solution for implementing high-order diversity receive paths\cite{Qualcomm.org}.
\end{itemize}

These exist several {\bfseries{\emph{Qualcomm's RF chips}}} on my iPhone's motherboard, which I will talk about in Section \ref{sec:rfc}. So I sought out Fig.\ref{fig:RF_Architecture} on Qualcomm's official website. Just as mentioned above, the Qualcomm RFFE solution includes a comprehensive family of chips: power amplifier modules, power trackers, antenna tuners, RF switches, diversity receive modules, integrated and discrete filters, multiplexers, and extractors. The Qualcomm RFFE solution is designed to address 5G design challenges.

\section{Different Waveforms} \label{sec:dw}
\subsection{FDD}
{\bfseries{\emph{Frequency Division Duplex(FDD)}}} requires two separate wireless communications channels on separate frequencies, one for transmit and the other for received data\cite{6983336}. 

FDD requires two symmetrical segments of spectrum for the uplink and downlink channels. Fig.\ref{fig:FDD} shows FDD waveform.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics*[width=0.8\linewidth]{FDD}
		\caption{\text{FDD Waveform}}
		\label{fig:FDD}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

FDD is used in the following wireless systems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Microwave (MW) Links
	\item Millimeter Wave (MMW) links
	\item Some 4G/LTE networks (some use TDD)
\end{itemize}

Wireless systems need two separate frequency bands or channels. A sufficient amount of guard band separates the two bands so the transmitter and receiver don't interfere with one another. Good filtering or duplexers and possibly shielding are a must to ensure the transmitter does not desensitize the adjacent receiver.

FDD uses lots of frequency spectrum, though, generally at least twice the spectrum needed by TDD. In addition, there must be adequate spectrum separation between the transmit and receive channels\cite{wireless.org}. These so-called guard bands aren't useable, so they're wasteful. Given the scarcity and expense of spectrum, these are real disadvantages.

FDD also works on a cable where transmit and receive channels are given different parts of the cable spectrum, as in cable TV systems. Again, filters are used to keep the channels separate.

\subsection{TDD}
{\bfseries{\emph{Time Division Duplex(TDD)}}} uses a single frequency band for both transmit and receive. Then it shares that band by assigning alternating time slots to transmit and receive operations. The information to be transmittedâ€”whether itâ€™s voice, video, or computer dataâ€”is in serial binary format. Each time slot may be 1 byte long or could be a frame of multiple bytes\cite{6983336}. 

TDD alternates the transmission and reception of station data over time. Time slots may be variable in length. Fig.\ref{fig:TDD} shows TDD waveform.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics*[width=0.8\linewidth]{TDD}
		\caption{\text{TDD Waveform}}
		\label{fig:TDD}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

TDD is used in the following wireless systems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item WiFi Networks
	\item Some 4G/LTE networks (some use FDD)
\end{itemize}

Because of the high-speed nature of the data, the communicating parties cannot tell that the transmissions are intermittent. The transmissions are concurrent rather than simultaneous. For digital voice converted back to analog, no one can tell it is not full duplex.

In some TDD systems, the alternating time slots are of the same duration or have equal DL and UL times. However, the system does not have to be 50/50 symmetrical. The system can be asymmetrical as required\cite{wireless.org}.

There are several comparisons about TDD and FDD in Table.\ref{table:comparisons_about_TDD_and_FDD} that are of particular interest to mobile or cellular telecommunications operators. These are naturally reflected into LTE.

\subsection{OFDM}
In telecommunications, {\bfseries{\emph{orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)}}} is a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication, used in applications such as digital television and audio broadcasting, DSL internet access, wireless networks, power line networks, and 4G mobile communications.

The main advantage of OFDM over single-carrier schemes is its ability to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and use echoes and time-spreading (in analog television visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs) where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be re-combined constructively, sparing interference of a traditional single-carrier system.\cite{Futaki2001Low}

Fig.\ref{fig:fdm} is the waveform of FDM, and Fig.\ref{fig:ofdm} is the waveform of OFDM. You can see the difference between FDM and OFDM. Obviously, OFDM do not need guard bands.

The process of OFDM is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:processOfOFDM}.

\subsection{Conclusion of Waveform}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You can see comparisons between FDD and TDD in Table.\ref{table:comparisons_about_TDD_and_FDD}.
	\item To tell the truth, OFDM is different from FDD and TDD. It can modulate and multiplex waveform at the same time. You can figure it out from Fig.\ref{fig:FDD}, Fig.\ref{fig:TDD} and Fig.\ref*{fig:processOfOFDM}.
	\item All in all, TDD, FDD, OFDM are widely used in the field of communication.

\section{Other RF Transceivers Chips} \label{sec:orft}
Before 2015, Appleâ€™s modem supplier was Qualcomm. But in 2016 when I bought my iPhone 7, Apple has taken a different approach with the decision to source two instead of one baseband chipset suppliers: Qualcomm and Intel.

Apple brought to market two iPhone 7 variants: the GSM/WCDMA/LTE with Intel modem version, and the GSM/CDMA/WCDMA/TD-SCDMA/LTE version with Qualcomm hardware. A new report is highlighting the first performance differences between the iPhone 7 featuring Intelâ€™s modem hardware compared to the iPhone 7 featuring Qualcomm modem hardware.

The report from Cellular Insights\cite{cellularinsights.org} finds that iPhone 7â€™s equipped with Qualcommâ€™s MDM9645M modem, which powers the (A1660, A1661) Verizon, Sprint, and SIM-free models, features better cellular performance than the (A1778, A1784) Intel version. Not only that, but the Qualcomm versionâ€™s ability to take advantage of Ultra HD Voice has been disabled as well according to the report.

There exit several tests about them two different RF Transceivers Chips what I found in website\cite{cellularinsights.org}.

We tested three unique LTE frequency bands, Band 12(10MHz), Band 4(20MHz), and Band 7(20MHz) in 4$\times$2 MIMO configuration using Transmission Mode 4. While both devices achieved the maximum sustained data rates at the cell center, simulating edge of cell scenarios by reducing power level did cause each iPhone to display two very different personalities.  This allows us to measure RF sensitivity of the device under test while eliminating inter-cell interference and fully controlling the radiated environment. This also allows for high reproducibility and consistency of our tests, and takes into account the performance of the entire RFFE subsystem. 

\subsection{FDD LTE Band 12(10MHz)}
FDD LTE Band 12 is part of the lower 700MHz band plan, covering 15 MHz of contiguous spectrum across three blocks (A, B, C). Most LTE Band 12 deployments are either 5 MHz or 10 MHz wide even though Band 12 can theoretically be deployed up to 15 MHz widths. Coincidentally, LTE Band 12 capable devices are only certified to support up to 10 MHz operation. As opposed to mid and high band spectrum, low frequency such as 700MHz Band 12 can propagate further, penetrate the concrete structure better, and often times is the only LTE layer reaching the device. For this particular reason, high sensitivity of a smartphone receiver is extremely important in challenging signal conditions, and it could make a difference between completing and dropping a VoLTE call.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

		\label{fig:band12}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Fig.\ref{fig:band12} shows that both iPhone 7 variants perform similarly in ideal conditions. At -96dBm the Intel variant needed to have Transport Block Size adjusted as BLER well exceeded the 2\% threshold. At -105dBm the gap widened to 20\%, and at -108dBm to a whopping 75\%. As a result of such a huge performance delta between the Intel and Qualcomm powered devices, we purchased another A1784 (AT\&T) iPhone 7, in order to eliminate any possibility of a faulty device. The end result was virtually identical. We are hoping that this sudden dip in performance at a specific RSRP value will be further investigated by the engineering and hopefully resolved. At -121dBm, the Intel variant performed more in line with its Qualcomm counterpart. Overall, the average performance delta between the two is in the 30\% range in favor of the Qualcomm variant. 

\subsection{FDD LTE Band 4\&7(20MHz)}
From Fig.\ref{fig:band4} and Fig.\ref{fig:band7}, we find that band 4 is the most commonly deployed LTE spectrum band in North America, while Band 7 deployments are spread across the rest of the globe. Mid and high spectrum bands are used to densify LTE networks and provide incremental capacity. Just like during our Band 12 tests, the iPhone 7 with the Intel modem continues to struggle even at relatively higher RSRP values with unexplainable sharp dips in performance. The gap between the two variants is consistent and north of 30\% again in favor of the Qualcomm variant.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison in Bad Conditions}
To put this into perspective, we have compared the edge of cell performance of a few other flagship devices to see how these iPhones compare in less than favorable conditions.

You can check results by observing Fig.\ref{fig:band4comparison}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item After testing, the conclusion is that the iPhone 7 hardware with the Qualcomm-powered modem has a significant cellular modem performance edge over the Intel variant.
	\item As to why Apple has sourced two baseband suppliers after years of using Qualcomm hardware exclusively, it likely has much to do with broadening its supply chain. In this case, however, it looks like supply chain diversification has resulted in a measurable performance difference between the two models in a lab-controlled environment.
	\item Also worth noting is that the iPhone 7 with the Qualcomm modem is only being sold in China, Japan and in the United States, which means that Apple deemed the Intel version to be good enough for every other territory.
	\item That said, if youâ€™re buying an iPhone 7 for full price in one of the aforementioned territories, then I highly recommend going with the Verizon/Sprint/SIM-free version. Not only does this version seem to perform better from a cellular modem perspective, but itâ€™s also capable of working with most cellular carriers in the US and abroad.	
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item From Table.\ref{table:Conclusion_of_Chips}, we can find that most of RF chips are designed and manufactured by American companies. These companies include {\bfseries{\emph{Qualcomm, Skyworks, Avago, TI}}}. In particular, almost all core chips in RF chips are produced by {\bfseries{\emph{Qualcomm}}}.
	\item From Table.\ref{table:comparisons_about_TDD_and_FDD}, we can draw a conclusion that whether we use {\bfseries{\emph{FDD, TDD or OFDM}}} depends on the actual situation. All of them can multiplex waveform. But only OFDM can modulate and multiplex waveform at the same time.
	\item From Fig.\ref{fig:band4}, \ref{fig:band7} and \ref{fig:band4comparison}, we can see that Qualcomm-powered modem is better than the Intel variant.
	\item What impressed me the most is that our country's {\bfseries{\emph{IC Design Situation}}} is not optimistic, especially after {\bfseries{\emph{ZTE incident}}} last year. This means that as the freshest force nowadays, we must take responsibility to let China have {\bfseries{\emph{a strong "chip"}}}.
